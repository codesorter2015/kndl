KINDLE WRAPPER
==============

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/PU2y582.png)

Uses node-webkit to provide a single-purpose window
onto Kindle's web version. Made in the same vein as
my earlier [twd](https://github.com/passcod/twd) but
actually works better for some reason out my control.

Require node-webkit 0.7.x or greater.

RUNNING
-------

### all platforms

#### from source:

```bash
# Install node-webkit
$ git clone git://github.com/passcod/kndl.git
$ cd kndl
$ nw .
```

#### from package:

```bash
# Install node-webkit
$ wget https://github.com/passcod/kndl/releases/download/v1.0.0/app.nw
$ nw app.nw
```

### pre-built binaries

These are a nightmare to make.
Do it yourself if you want to.
